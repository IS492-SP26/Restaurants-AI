Opening a restaurant requires coordinating knowledge across market analysis, financial planning, operations design, and regulatory compliance. However, most small business founders do not have access to multidisciplinary expert teams, and existing AI tools mainly support isolated tasks such as content generation or operational automation rather than end-to-end launch planning.

This project explores whether a multi-agent AI system can assist aspiring restaurant owners by generating locally grounded, multi-domain launch plans with minimal human input, using Green Street in Champaign as a case study.
